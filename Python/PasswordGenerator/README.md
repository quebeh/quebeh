# Password Generator

Hello! this code will allow you to generate passwords up to 30 characters!

Library Required :
- [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)
- [Pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/)
- Random (Default)
- Time (Default)

How it works :
1. Program waits for user input, which is clicking \[Generate] button.
2. Once the button is pressed, it makes the password, which uses a for loop with a random.choice randomization.
3. When the password generating is done, (which will take less than .5 seconds) it will store it to a variable, show it to the text
4. If the \[Copy] button is pressed, it will copy the password to your clipboard.

### It is simple!

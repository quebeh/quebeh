# Dice Roller

Hello! this code will make your life easier if your dice accidentally thrown to the river by your friend

Library Required :
- [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)
- [Pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/)
- Random (Default)
- Datetime (Default)

How it works :
1. It generates a different seed every second, with the power of datetime
2. If the roll button is clicked, it takes the value of the "How much dices are going to be rolled" and roll dices X times (x = value of how much dice)
3. When it is done, it will show the result and seed used.

### At least it's not rocket science.

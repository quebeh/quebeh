# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Hello! this code will allow you to play Rock Paper Scissors with no one!

Library Required :
- [PySimpleGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PySimpleGUI/)
- Random (Default)

How it works? 
- It waits for a user input, \['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']
- If it gets a user input, (Lets say Paper), it picks a choice, \['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']
- After that, it will determine which won, player or bot.

###### Pretty Simple, right?
